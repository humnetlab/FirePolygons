# Abstract
The [Catalan Fire Service](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/bombers/en) pioneered an innovative approach to guide proactive fire management, manually drawing [polygons of fire potential](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42408-019-0048-6) and connections using expected fire behavior on the landscape. However, this manual drawing process is time-consuming, subjective, and relies heavily on expert judgment. To address this limitation, we introduce a method to automatically generate fire potential polygons and connect them into a weighted network based on fire behavior. To this end, we use a [cellular automata-based 2D fire growth model](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/forests-and-global-change/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2021.692706/full) under dynamic weather conditions to simulate fire behavior. We calculate the elapsed time computed from fire spread simulations and propose a method inspired by [basin delineation tools from hydrology](https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap1008/p1008.htm) to segment polygons on the landscape. These polygons are subsequently connected into a network, using a weighted rate of spread metric to characterize the connections. Our method produces automated polygons, networks of the polygons connected by various fire behavior metrics, major fire pathways, and network visualizations of simulated scenarios. 

We validate our approach on two wildfire case studies in Catalonia (Spain) during the 2024 fire season. Our approach is applied during the initial attack of two fires that had the potential to grow large with a high risk of invoking catastrophic damage. In the wind-driven **Ciutadilla fire** [(News Article)](https://www.catalannews.com/society-science/item/forest-fire-forces-lockdown-of-two-towns-in-lleida), the polygon networks were able to identify high-risk polygons, connections, and critical fire pathways that aligned with real operations on the ground. In the **Vilanova fire** [(News Article)](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/20240809/incendio-vilanova-meia-confinamiento-106814577), we present how our modeling approach can integrate various suppression tactics and a prescribed burn to update the networks and assess the amount of time gained through the suppression.

## But how do the polygons get modeled using basin delineation from "hydrology" principles?
Since fire does not spread on the landscape like water flowing in a drainage basin, we model fire behavior using the elapsed time (i.e., arrival of time) from Cell2Fire simulations. Time is a continuous quantity which
