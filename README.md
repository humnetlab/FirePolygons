Background
---------------------
Climate change has intensified fire-conducive weather conditions, leading to catastrophic wildfires and overwhelming suppression efforts. Traditionally, fire management has been reactive, straining resources and reducing suppression efficiency. In response, the Catalan Fire Service pioneered a proactive approach to guide fire management, manually drawing polygons of fire potential and arrows representing fire spread potential on the landscape. However, this manual drawing process is time-consuming, subjective, and relies heavily on expert judgment. To address this limitation, we developed a method to automatically generate fire potential polygons and connect them into a weighted network based on fire behavior. Concretely, we used a cellular automata fire spread model under dynamic weather conditions to simulate fire behavior. We, then, leveraged basin delineation tools from hydrology to segment fire potential polygons from elapsed time computed from fire spread simulations. These polygons are subsequently connected into a network model, using a density-weighted rate of spread metric to characterize the connections. Our method produces automated polygons, networks of the polygons connected by various fire behavior metrics, major fire pathways, and network visualizations of simulated scenarios. We validated our approach on two wildfire case studies in Catalonia (Spain) during the 2024 fire season. In the wind-driven Ciutadilla fire, the polygon networks were able to identify high-risk polygons and connections and highlight critical fire pathways that aligned with real operations on the ground. In the Vilanova fire, we presented how our modeling approach can integrate suppression tactics and a prescribed burn to update the networks and assess the amount of time gained through the suppression. Through these results, we demonstrate that our approach expedites the original process and provides essential information to support decision-making during fire suppression. As wildfires continue to damage our built and natural environments on a global scale, our proposed method can be integrated into existing risk-based frameworks and can be used by various fire services around the world to streamline fire management and improve fire management and response.
